    ///   Sub-scenes (11_LopHoc, 12_NhaAn, 13_KyTucXa) ship with a PlayerSpawn
    ///   GameObject at a known position. With LoadReplacing replacing 10_World
    ///   when entering a building, the player needs to (a) not get destroyed
    ///   along with 10_World, and (b) appear at the sub-scene's spawn point
    ///   rather than at world coordinates that mean nothing inside the new
    ///   scene.
    ///
    /// Attach to:
    ///   The Player root GameObject (the one with PlayerController + CharacterController).
    ///   Attaches ONCE per game session; subsequent copies destroy themselves so
    ///   re-loading a scene with a baked Player doesn't double-spawn.
    ///
    /// Singleton-by-survival pattern: if an Instance already exists (from an
    /// earlier scene), the newer one self-destructs. This is more robust than
    /// FindObjectsOfType-based dedup, which races with scene Awake order.
